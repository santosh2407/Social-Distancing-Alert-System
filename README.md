# Social-Distancing-Alert-System
- With the significant increase in the cases of Covid-19, social distancing has become very important. The epidemic situation may keep on getting worst without social distancing. To tackle this situation, the Social Distancing Reminder System can be proved beneficial to keep the distance between each other. 
- In this project I've used a buzzer to give alert to the user if the there is no social distance between the people. The distance between two people is measured by using an ultrasonic sensor.
